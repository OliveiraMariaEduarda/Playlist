        <h1>Mad at Disney</h1>
        <p>
            I'm mad at Disney, Disney<br>
They tricked me, tricked me<br>
Had me wishing on a shooting star<br>
But now I'm twenty-something<br>
I still know nothing<br>
About who I am or what I'm not<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            So call me a pessimist<br>
But I don't believe in it<br>
Finding a true love's kiss is bullshit<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            'Cause I felt sad love<br>
I felt bad love<br>
Sometimes happy love (happy love)<br>
Turns into giving up (giving up)<br>
I felt hurt love<br>
By the word love<br>
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?<br>
What the hell is love? What the hell is love?<br>
What the hell is love supposed to feel like?<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            My fairy grandma warned me<br>
Cinderella's story<br>
Only ended in a bad divorce<br>
The prince ain't sleeping when he<br>
Takes his sleeping beauty<br>
To the motel on his snow-white horse<br>
        </p>
